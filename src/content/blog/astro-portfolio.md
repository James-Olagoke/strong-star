Astro is perfect for **content-first** sites like portfolios and blogs. In this guide, youâ€™ll scaffold a project, add pages, style with Tailwind, and deploy.

## Why Astro?
- Zero-JS by default for fast loads
- File-based routing (pages are just files)
- Content Collections for tidy blogs
- Easy deploys to Vercel/Netlify

## 1) Create a new Astro project
```bash
npm create astro@latest
cd my-portfolio
npm run dev
